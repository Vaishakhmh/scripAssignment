Build a web application which lets employees of an organisation to add/manage challenges for internal hackathons which they organise every month. Let's call this application Hack Ideas.
The application should have these features,
* Allow users to enter into application with 'employee id'(password is not necessary).
* Allow users to add a new challenges/ideas.
* A challenge will have a title, description and tags
* You can maintain fixed pre-defined tags (like 'feature', 'tech' etc.)
* Users can upvote a challenge
* Show the list of all challenges on home page
* Allow users to sort challenges with votes count, creation date

Notes:
- You need to build the frontend application.
- Data can be stored in browser storage or you can use cloud DB like firebase or you can implement RESTful JSON API.
- You can write the frontend in any Javascript framework of your choice.
- You can use any popular CSS frameworks like Bootstrap/Materialize for the UI.
- Try to keep the use of external libraries/packages to a minimum.
